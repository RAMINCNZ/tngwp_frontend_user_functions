{"tagline":"Custom Registration, Login and Front-end Profile for TNG-WordPress integrations.","body":"# TNG User Meta WordPress Plugin\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom Registration, Login and Front-end Profile for TNG-WordPress integrations.\r\n\r\nThis plugin is specifically designed to work as a user interface for Wordpress/TNG integrations. It provides shortcodes for two levels of registration, a shortcode for a front-end profile page, a one-line login/logout shortcode, and a login/logout widget. I recommend you use this plugin in conjunction with two other plugins: Confirm User Registration and your choice of any of the honeypot plugins. The registration forms use a simple javascript captcha so you will need some backup spam protection.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this plugin requires [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/) and the tng-wordpress-plugin to function.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Simple Registration Form](http://uniquelyyours.blogdns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-1.png)\r\n![Select Ancestor Screen](http://uniquelyyours.blogdns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-2.png)\r\n![Advanced Registration Form](http://uniquelyyours.blogdns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-3.png)\r\n![Profile Page](http://uniquelyyours.blogdns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-4.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* Download the compressed file to your computer.\r\n* In Plugins --> Add New, select 'upload,' browse to the file you downloaded and click on 'Install Now.'\r\n* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### ver 1.2\r\n* Added checks for existing usernames and emails.\r\n* Added password validation to Profile page.\r\n* Created option to set the page for the profile.\r\n* Added screenshots.\r\n* Cleaned up more code.\r\n\r\n### ver 1.1\r\n* Updated all deprecated code and cleaned up coding errors,\r\n\r\n### ver 1.0\r\n* Initial Release","name":"Tng User Meta","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
