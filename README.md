# TNG User Managment

Custom Registration, Login and Front-end Profile for TNG-WordPress integrations.

This plugin is specifically designed to work as a user interface for Wordpress/TNG integrations. It provides shortcodes for two levels of registration, a shortcode for a front-end profile page and user management for both TNG and WordPress.

Please note that this plugin requires [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/) and the [TNG WordPress Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tng-wordpress-plugin/) to function.
