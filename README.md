TNG_User_Meta
=============

Custom Registration, Login and Front-end Profile for TNG-WordPress integrations.

This plugin is specifically designed to work as a user interface for Wordpress/TNG integrations. It provides shortcodes for two levels of registration, a shortcode for a front-end profile page, a one-line login/logout shortcode, and a login/logout widget. I recommend you use this plugin in conjunction with two other plugins: Confirm User Registration and your choice of any of the honeypot plugins. The registration forms use a simple javascript captcha so you will need some backup spam protection.

Please note that this plugin requires [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/) and the tng-wordpress-plugin to function.
